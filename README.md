This is a template app. Steps to get started:

    git clone git@github.com:jess/contract_app.git
    bundle install
    yarn install

Rename all references of `ContractApp` or `contract_app` to whatever
you want your app name to be.

Commit your changes.

To regenerate the credentials file, we need to keep Devise from
squawking we need to uncomment the 10th line in
`config/initializers/devise.rb` referencing `config.secret_key`

Then run:

    rm config/credentials.yml.enc # will regenerate
    bin/rails credentials:edit # once open, just save and close


This will generate your master key file and encrypted credentials
file. You can add the comment back to the devise file.

Rename the .env.sample file to .env to setup ENV vars

Now run your normal `rake db:create db:migrate` and you're good to go.

Now you can pull in branches of the features you want.
